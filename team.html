                      <p>Helen Rivas-Rose lived with severe shyness for 50 years. It truncated her education, denied her a career, oriented her two marriages, and affected her parenting. In midlife, she decided to do what was necessary to overcome it, taking self-directed steps that included: singing solo in public, delivering her own talks at Unitarian-Universalist churches, joining drama workshops to expose her childhood pain, and joining a typical socially oriented garden club.</p>
                      <p>
                        With help from SCORE of Portland, Maine, and Dr. Kevin Crowley, school principal in Kennebunk, Maine, Rivas-Rose founded The Center for Social Isolation Relief, (CSIR) a non-profit tax-exempt organization. Its mission is to provide relief to socially isolated children and youth so they can unite with their peers. Rivas-Rose serves as program manager and CSIR works on designing and implementing projects for schools that will help children develop more self-confidence and social connections.

                        Antony has worked as a police community support officer for the London Met Police since 2006, primarily giving crime prevention advice. His role includes promoting any activities which support the socially isolated. One example is the LoneliLESS group run by colleagues in the neighborhood where he works. They offer a chance for people who are alone to get together once a fortnight for a couple of hours. Antony handles social media for CSIR.

                      <p>Through my own personal experience as an incarcerated man of color and someone who has struggled with addiction issues as well as an individual who has worked with others overcoming addiction as well as with immigrant youth, I have examined progression which occurs in group settings but fails when attempted therapeutically in isolation. I also have recognized that there are limitations to what can get done in group settings when the state of the group is non cohesive. I am of the belief that humans are fundamentally social creatures and not only is this indispensable to our progress as beings on this Earth but also to the processing of experiences which if not dealt with through social interaction are very likely to mutate in the self. In time such experiences may lead to behavioral issues, mental health challenges and even stress-induced autoimmune diseases. However when utilized they can facilitate greater connections among fellows as well as empower the individuals who have endured.</p>
